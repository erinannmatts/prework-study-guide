# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

This is a study guide for prework activity in preparation for our coding bootcamp. This serves as a quick reference guide to basics, and an example output of lab work performed to achieve these basic commands.

- This webpage was built as a reference and to test coding capabilities as outlined in the prework module
- This project was built to ensure full understanding of not only the definitions of the basics in coding (book work), but actual real-world practice and solutions
- This solves the problem of a user havin go filter through a large amount of information. It cleanly summarizes the key points of learning in the process.
- This user learned the basics of critical tools and applications (Terminal, VS code, GitHub, Chrome Dev Tools), as well as initial applications in three core languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

Badges aren't necessary, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.edone prework study guide
